# **Cardiovascular Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning**


**Project Description**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Overview**
* The project aims to predict the likelihood of a person developing cardiovascular disease using various machine learning algorithms.
* The system alerts individuals about potential cardiovascular risks based on the prediction results.
  
**Machine Learning Algorithms Used**
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree (DT)
* Random Forest (RF)
* Gradient Boosting
* AdaBoost
* XGBoost
  
**Data Collection and Preprocessing**
* The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, ensuring it is large and efficient for accurate predictions.
* Initial data preprocessing involves handling null values, which can significantly impact the model's training.
* The dataset is normalized to ensure all features contribute equally to the prediction model.
Model Development
* Structured datasets based on patient heart characteristics are used to train the model.
Logistic regression and other algorithms are employed to create models that predict the patient's illness based on the given data.
* The prediction model is developed in a way to provide high accuracy and reliability.

**Key Features**
* Prediction and Alert System: Predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease and alerts users.
* Multiple Algorithms: Utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms for robust prediction.
* User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-understand output for users regarding their cardiovascular risk.
