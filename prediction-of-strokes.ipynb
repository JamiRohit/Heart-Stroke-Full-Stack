Regularly check your blood pressure and follow medical advice for managing hypertension.\n","\n","4. **Manage Cholesterol Levels:** 🌡️ High cholesterol levels can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing stroke risk. Consult a healthcare provider for cholesterol management.\n","\n","5. **Quit Smoking:** 🚭 Smoking damages blood vessels and raises the risk of blood clots. Quitting smoking is one of the most effective ways to reduce stroke risk.\n","\n","6. **Limit Alcohol Consumption:** 🍷 Excessive alcohol intake can raise blood pressure and contribute to stroke risk. Consume alcohol in moderation or as recommended by healthcare professionals.\n","\n","7. **Control Diabetes:** 🩸 If you have diabetes, manage it carefully through medication, diet, and regular monitoring to prevent complications that increase stroke risk.\n","\n","8. **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** ⚖️ Obesity is linked to a higher risk of stroke. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce this risk.\n","\n","9. **Stay Hydrated:** 💧 Proper hydration is important for overall health, including cardiovascular health.
